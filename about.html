I am a creative professional leveraging contemporary art and design that help innovative and non-profit companies achieve their aesthetic and socially engaged goals. Often thinking about the intersection of art, technology, and social responsibility. Experienced in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript-based programming and a background in React/Redux.
