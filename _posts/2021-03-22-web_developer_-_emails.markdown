I've been asked to create an email for a graphic designer position. The position required knowledge of programming and design. This post will be about figuring out that process - email developer jobs are different from other coding jobs.

I've been tasked to create: 

For this section, please draft an email with the following information:

Customer reviews:
1. Having to homeschool the kids and spend my daily 9-5 in front of a screen has doubled my headaches (I don’t consider myself tech-savvy, it was a struggle!)
I’ve tried it all, cold compresses, vitamins, essential oils..but no luck. I finally learned about blue light and bought myself a pair of specs from Topfoxx. They work like a charm! (My hubbie steals them on occasion too ;) - Michelle

2. I work about 9 hrs per day  from my laptop and iPhone (and spend another 1-2 binging on Netflix, oops) I used to spend HOURS staring at the ceiling lying in bed at night, tossing and turning. My bff bought me a pair of  blue light blockers for my bday and now I consider myself the most rested (trendy) workaholic around ;) Thanks Topfoxx! - Stephanie

I will be using BeePro.io, something that seemed the easiest to use for templates and easy designs. https://pro.beefree.io/649100/631317/projects
