Project notes:
What is a wealthy person?
a wealthy person has a name
a wealthy person has a ranking
a wealthy person has a description 
want an object that has these properties that the CLI can just use
go to website, find the people
extract the properties
instantiate a person 

I am on day 4! The first day, I made my flowchart and tried out some code while looking at a few references for similar projects. THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO! 

By day 2, I had code that I didn't full understand how to run. That was not the right way to approach building this. After talking to a friend on the slack channel, he told me it was imperative that I watch the videos on building basic CLI's that are provided to us. Thank goodness he told me to do that! 

On day 3, I watched half of the video, it was only 30 minutes but in order to code along, write notes, and understand what Avi was saying, I had to pause the video a bunch of times. So, 30 minutes in, but really, a couple hours in! It was so helpful, though. I understood more after watching that video than I did in a long time. Big win!

Day 4, I have a project that fully runs and works, after watching both of the videos and coding along - but there is something missing. My project, worlds wealthiest people, displays to the user a list of the 50 wealthiest people and their descriptions. The list shows their name and rankings. I want that data to be seperate, but I'm not sure what I did wrong with my CLI just yet. The user has the option to see all of that data together as a list, or exit. I'm just happy that it runs, and that I understand it up until this point! 

I was going to submit just that, because I think it still met all the requirements, but I decided to turn in a project help form to see what I could improve so that the user could interact with the project more.  Overall, I've put about...maybe 30 hours into this so far. And it has been...pretty fun and rewarding! I actually created new github repositories maybe 3 or 4 times...and even tried out an easier project idea! And I haven't been too frustrated yet...good sign I should keep going and keep practicing! 

STAY TUNED!

TO RUN IN TERMINAL:
./bin/Worlds-Wealthiest-People

This was a long day of working, and it is not a perfect CLI by any means. The data is sort of clunky. But I was so unclear on so much and doing all of this, collaborating on slack, watching videos, was all such an incredible experience. I am proud of my first project! It prompts the user for input, gives the user options, and (I think) the code is clear to me, but I am going to write line by line what the code is saying before I turn everything in.
