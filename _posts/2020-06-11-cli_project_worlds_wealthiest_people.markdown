I am on day 4! The first day, I made my flowchart and tried out some code while looking at a few references for similar projects. THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO! 

By day 2, I had code that I didn't full understand how to run. That was not the right way to approach building this. After talking to a friend on the slack channel, he told me it was imperative that I watch the videos on building basic CLI's that are provided to us. Thank goodness he told me to do that! 

On day 3, I watched half of the video, it was only 30 minutes but in order to code along, write notes, and understand what Avi was saying, I had to pause the video a bunch of times. So, 30 minutes in, but really, a couple hours in! It was so helpful, though. I understood more after watching that video than I did in a long time. Big win!

Day 4, I have a project that fully runs and works, after watching both of the videos and coding along - but there is something missing. My project, worlds wealthiest people, displays to the user a list of the 50 wealthiest people and their descriptions. The list shows their name and rankings. I want that data to be seperate, but I'm not sure what I did wrong with my CLI just yet. The user has the option to see all of that data together as a list, or exit. I'm just happy that it runs, and that I understand it up until this point! 

I was going to submit just that, because I think it still met all the requirements, but I decided to turn in a project help form to see what I could improve so that the user could interact with the project more. 

STAY TUNED!
