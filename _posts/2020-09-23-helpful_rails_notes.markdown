#new instantiates a new ActiveRecord model without saving it to the database, whereas #create immediately attempts to save it, as if you had called #new and then #save.

I attended the weekly study groups to understand errors I couldn't figure out myself. They were the most helpful part of the project! It was so nice to work with other people being an online self paced student. 

Project Planning:

Models: User, art_schedule, art_plan, art_project 

User: has many art plans, has many art projects through art plans, and has many art schedules through art projects

art_schedule: belongs to art project, belongs to art plan 

art_plan: belongs to user, has many art schedules, has many art projects, through art schedules 

art project: has many art schedules, has many art plans through art schedules
