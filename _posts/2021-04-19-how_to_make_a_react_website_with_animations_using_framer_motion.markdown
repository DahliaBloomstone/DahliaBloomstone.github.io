Getting Started with Create React App.

Framer motion is a production-ready motion library for React, using react hooks and styled components for this project.

Also thinking about: top 12 design trends to expect in 2021,  3D Design and 3D Typography Design! 

So we'll build a fun page today with some trends and some coding. I'll do some sort of CHROME CUSTOM TYPEFACE in BLENDER 2.91! 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion

Framer Motion is an open source, production-ready library that's designed for all creative developers.

I keep getting this error:  Module not found: Can't resolve 'styled-components' in '/Users/dahliabloomstone/Character-creator/Scripting/Framer Motion/react-framer/src/components'

Trying to figure that out!

npm i styled-components should work...and it worked! Finally. There were a bunch of module errors throughout this that were fixed by installing both framer motion and the above.
