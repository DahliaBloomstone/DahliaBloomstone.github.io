I'm trying to work on both design and code challenges every single week. So, what's this week?! 
I think I'm going to try to build a glass website in html and css, and also try some stuff out in adobe character animator and unreal engine! Whenever I create a new app or webpage, I want to only put my original artwork on there! So it's exciting to be creating characters and uploading them to something simple like Giphy, and adding them quickly to the code!
