 Implementation from design to code!

Since the launch of the Figma API, many people have speculated about the possibility of automatically turning Figma documents into React components.

Figma inspect is a great feature by Figma by which you can convert your design element into code.. it provides various options from which you can convert your design into Android (XML), iOS (Swift), Web (CSS) with so much ease.. you just have to select any element from the design and it will generate the code for it.

A design system is a living style guide that’s collaborative and code-connected. It’s not just a style guide where designers are the only contributors. It’s shared across the whole team, including designers, developers, product managers, etc. As a result, the design system should be cohesive, dynamic, reusable and maintainable both in design and code.
