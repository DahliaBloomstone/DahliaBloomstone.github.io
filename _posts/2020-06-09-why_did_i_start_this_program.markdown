My senior year of college I learned about a few artists that used code for their art projects in my Electronic Art class, like Cory Arcangel, Jordan Wolfson, and JODI. The best fine artists make art that people cannot understand how to do themselves. I have used software like blender and cinema 4d to create art narratives, and those skills allowed me to challenge myself and learn how to create through practice and hard work.

I have thought about using coding to create art projects for so long, and now that I am in my first year of graduate school for art, now is the perfect time to learn so I can create the best senior project I can in two years.

Now that I have actually done some of the work (up to the CLI project- so scary!) in the self paced program and talked to people who work in software engineering, I know that I can also see myself working in it as a full time career. I loe that both software engineering and art are heavily collaborative. Cultivating these skills has become so important to me and I am really excited to see where I can go both in working in this field and in creating and broadening my art projects.
